/// For this to work your store state must have a `Wait` field named `wait`,
/// and then:
///
/// 1) The state must have a `copy` or `copyWith` method that copies this
/// field as a named parameter. For example:
///
/// ```
/// class AppState {
///   final Wait wait;
///   AppState({this.wait});
///   AppState copy({Wait wait}) => AppState(wait: wait);
///   }
/// ```
///
/// OR:
///
/// 2) You must use the BuiltValue package https://pub.dev/packages/built_value,
/// which automatically creates a `rebuild` method.
///
/// OR:
///
/// 3) You must use the Freezed package https://pub.dev/packages/freezed,
/// which automatically creates the `copyWith` method.
///
/// OR:
///
/// 4) Inject your own [WaitReducer] implementation into [WaitAction]
/// by replacing the static variable [WaitAction.reducer] with a callback
/// that changes the wait object as you see fit.
///
/// OR:
///
/// 5) Don't use the [WaitAction], but instead create your own `MyWaitAction`
/// that uses the [Wait] object in whatever way you want.
