# flutter-toolkit
This package inspired by `redux-toolkit` (A toolset for Redux) and from React-Native with love.

This package is a combination of:
- redux: https://pub.dev/packages/redux
- flutter_redux: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_redux
- async_redux: https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux
- flutter_redux_hooks: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_redux_hooks
- reselect: https://pub.dev/packages/reselect
- flutter_hooks: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks

I tried to bring react-native-functionalities-like as much as i can so that React-Native developer can start with Flutter easier.

## Getting Started
- Add following to pubspec:
```
flutter_toolkit:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/newoceaninfosys/flutter-toolkit.git
      ref: master
```

## Example:
